# corewar
This project was developed as one of the group-projects of Ecole 42 curriculum. Corewar is a virtual “arena” in which programs (“The Champions”) fight against each other.  These battle programs are written in an abstract assembly language. 
There is also an assembler which compiles the Champions.
For more information about the game history, please read: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_War
